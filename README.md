## üßò About the Project

SimpleBreathScore is an open-source application designed to help users master the art of slow, controlled breathing. Originally created as a tool to help with Kundalini Yoga's "One Minute Breath" technique, the app provides real-time feedback and scoring to guide users toward optimal breathing patterns for meditation, stress reduction, and overall wellness.

Unlike many meditation apps that focus only on guided sessions, SimpleBreathScore uses a sophisticated algorithm to analyze your breathing patterns and provide a precise score (0.00-10.00) that reflects your mastery of slow, controlled breathing.

### Origin Story

This project was born out of personal practice with Kundalini Yoga's breathing techniques. The creator's mother was learning the One Minute Breath technique but had no way to track her progress objectively. SimpleBreathScore was created to fill this gap, providing precise metrics on breathing performance and progress over time.

## üåü Key Features

- **Breathing Session Recorder**: Capture inhale/exhale patterns with precision timing
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual cues guide your breathing practice
- **Detailed Session Analytics**: Comprehensive metrics after each session
- **Breathing Score (0.00-10.00)**: Scientific scoring based on breathing rate and consistency
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor improvement over time with session history
- **Offline Capability**: Practice anywhere with full offline functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices from mobile to desktop
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development and customization

## üå¨Ô∏è The One Minute Breath

The One Minute Breath is a powerful Kundalini Yoga technique where one complete breath cycle takes a full minute:

- **Inhale** for 20 seconds
- **Hold** for 20 seconds
- **Exhale** for 20 seconds

This creates a rhythm of just one breath per minute‚Äîfar below the average person's 12-16 breaths per minute.

### Benefits According to Tradition & Science

- Calms the mind and reduces anxiety
- Balances the nervous system
- Improves oxygen utilization
- Enhances mental clarity
- Reduces stress hormones
- Improves heart rate variability
- Strengthens respiratory muscles

### Progression Path

- **Beginner**: 6-12 breaths per minute
- **Intermediate**: 4-6 breaths per minute
- **Advanced**: 1-4 breaths per minute
- **Master**: 1 breath per minute

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.x or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fcavalcantirj/simplebreathscore.com.git
   cd simplebreathscore
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## üìñ Usage

### Starting a Session

1. Tap the "Start Session" button when you're ready to begin.
2. Find a comfortable position where you can remain undisturbed.
3. Press the "Inhale" button at the exact moment you begin breathing in.
4. Press the "Exhale" button when you start breathing out.
5. When you're ready to finish, press the "Stop" button.

### Understanding Your Results

After each session, you'll see:

- **Overall Score** (0.00-10.00)
- **Breaths Per Minute** (key performance metric)
- **Session Duration** (total meditation time)
- **Average Breath Cycle** (average length of complete breaths)
- **Detailed Timeline** (exact record of your breathing pattern)

### Tips for Best Results

- Focus on reducing your breathing rate below 6 breaths per minute
- Advanced practitioners aim for less than 4 breaths per minute
- Perfect scores come from reaching approximately 1 breath per minute
- There's no rigid pattern you must follow‚Äîyour natural rhythm is what matters

## üßÆ Scoring Algorithm

The scoring algorithm is at the heart of SimpleBreathScore. It evaluates your breathing session based primarily on breaths per minute (BPM), with additional factors for consistency and session length.

```javascript
function calculateBreathingScore(startTime, inhaleTimestamps, exhaleTimestamps, stopTime) {
    // Core measurements
    const sessionDurationMinutes = (stopTime - startTime) / (1000 * 60);
    const breathCount = inhaleTimestamps.length;
    
    // Calculate breaths per minute (primary metric)
    const breathsPerMinute = breathCount / sessionDurationMinutes;
    
    // Base score calculation (granular with decimals)
    let score;
    
    if (breathsPerMinute <= 1) {
        // 1 BPM or less (perfect): Score range 9.50 - 10.00
        const deviation = Math.abs(1 - breathsPerMinute);
        score = 10 - (deviation * 0.5); 
    } 
    else if (breathsPerMinute <= 4) {
        // Between 1-4 BPM: Score range 7.00 - 9.49
        score = 9.5 - ((breathsPerMinute - 1) * (2.5/3));
    } 
    else if (breathsPerMinute <= 6) {
        // Between 4-6 BPM: Score range 5.00 - 6.99
        score = 7 - ((breathsPerMinute - 4) * (2/2));
    } 
    else if (breathsPerMinute <= 12) {
        // Between 6-12 BPM: Score range 0.01 - 4.99
        score = 5 - ((breathsPerMinute - 6) * (5/6));
    } 
    else {
        // More than 12 BPM: Score is 0
        score = 0;
    }
    
    // Secondary adjustments for session length
    const durationBonus = Math.min(0.49, sessionDurationMinutes / 60);
    
    // For very good scores (7+), apply consistency adjustment
    let consistencyAdjustment = 0;
    if (score >= 7 && breathCount > 3) {
        // Calculate intervals between inhales
        const intervals = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < inhaleTimestamps.length - 1; i++) {
            intervals.push(inhaleTimestamps[i+1] - inhaleTimestamps[i]);
        }
        
        // Calculate stats
        const avgInterval = intervals.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0) / intervals.length;
        const stdDev = Math.sqrt(intervals.reduce((sum, val) => sum + Math.pow(val - avgInterval, 2), 0) / intervals.length);
        const cv = stdDev / avgInterval;
        
        // Apply adjustment (-0.25 to +0.25)
        consistencyAdjustment = 0.25 - (cv * 0.5);
        consistencyAdjustment = Math.max(-0.25, Math.min(0.25, consistencyAdjustment));
    }
    
    // Final score with all adjustments
    const finalScore = Math.max(0, Math.min(10, score + durationBonus + consistencyAdjustment));
    
    // Return score with 2 decimal places
    return parseFloat(finalScore.toFixed(2));
}
```

### Score Ranges and Meanings

- **9.50-10.00**: Mastery (approximately 1 BPM)
- **7.00-9.49**: Advanced (1-4 BPM)
- **5.00-6.99**: Intermediate (4-6 BPM)
- **0.01-4.99**: Beginner (6-12 BPM)
- **0.00**: Needs practice (>12 BPM)
