# Initial Development Prompt

This prompt was used to guide the development of the application, including:
- Core breathing session tracking functionality
- Scoring algorithm implementation
- UI/UX design decisions
- Technical architecture choices

The prompt served as a foundational document that outlined the vision and requirements for the project.

Momma's Little Helper" Breathing App

## CONTEXT
Create a polished, performance-optimized meditation tracking application called "Momma's Little Helper" using modern React or Next.js, focusing on mastery of slow, controlled breathing techniques. The app measures breathing performance with a sophisticated scoring algorithm that rewards users who achieve fewer breaths per minute (ultimate goal: 1 breath per minute with the ideal 20-20-20 pattern of inhale-hold-exhale).

## AUDIENCE
- Primary user: A mother learning Kundalini breathing techniques
- Secondary users: Anyone interested in meditation, breath control, or stress reduction
- Skill level: Accessible to beginners but sophisticated enough for advanced practitioners

## REQUEST
Design a responsive React/Next.js application with the following:

1. *Technology Stack:*
   - Frontend: React.js or Next.js (preferred for better SEO and performance)
   - State Management: React Context API or Redux Toolkit (for complex state)
   - Styling: Styled Components, Tailwind CSS, or Chakra UI
   - Animations: Framer Motion for fluid, physics-based animations
   - Data Persistence: localStorage with custom hooks
   - Build/Deployment: Vercel or Netlify for static site generation

2. *Core Functionality:*
   - Breathing session recorder with React-based timer implementation
   - React-controlled inhale/exhale button components
   - Component-based results dashboard with detailed metrics
   - Custom hooks for local storage interaction
   - Context-based user preferences and history management

3. *User Experience:*
   - SVG/Canvas-based animated breathing guide with React spring physics
   - Declarative animation patterns for visual feedback
   - Custom hook for device vibration/haptic feedback
   - React-based audio management for ambient sounds
   - Session recording using immutable state patterns

4. *Performance Considerations:*
   - Code splitting for faster initial load
   - React.memo() for expensive render components
   - useCallback/useMemo for optimized event handlers
   - Lazy loading for secondary features
   - Service worker registration for offline capabilities

## STYLE
Implement a modern React component architecture with these design principles:
- Utilize CSS-in-JS or utility-based styling (Tailwind) for component scoping
- Implement theme provider pattern for consistent styling and dark/light mode
- Create reusable animation components using Framer Motion
- Use React portals for modals and overlays
- Implement proper a11y patterns with React-Aria or similar

## EXEMPLARY QUALITY INDICATORS
- *Component Architecture:* Clean separation of concerns, reusable components
- *Custom Hooks:* Well-designed hooks for timer, storage, breathing detection
- *State Management:* Appropriate use of local vs. global state
- *Performance:* Optimized render cycles, no unnecessary re-renders
- *Code Quality:* TypeScript typing (optional but preferred), consistent patterns

## STRUCTURE
1. *Component Hierarchy*
   - <App /> - Root component with router
   - <BreathingSession /> - Core session management
   - <BreathingControls /> - Button interface
   - <BreathingVisualizer /> - Animated guide
   - <ResultsDashboard /> - Post-session analysis
   - <HistoryView /> - Past sessions and leaderboard

2. *Custom Hooks*
   - useBreathingSession - Core session state management
   - useBreathingScore - Algorithm implementation
   - useSessionStorage - Persistent data management
   - useBreathingAnimation - Animation control
   - useAudioFeedback - Sound management

3. *Contexts*
   - BreathingSessionContext - Active session data
   - UserPreferencesContext - Settings/preferences
   - HistoryContext - Past sessions management

## SPECIFICS
- *Algorithm Implementation:* Create a custom React hook that implements the exact scoring algorithm:

javascript
// useBreathingScore.js
export function useBreathingScore() {
  // This implementation can be called at the end of a session to calculate score
  const calculateScore = useCallback((startTime, inhaleTimestamps, exhaleTimestamps, stopTime) => {
    // Core measurements
    const sessionDurationMinutes = (stopTime - startTime) / (1000 * 60);
    const breathCount = inhaleTimestamps.length;
    
    // Calculate breaths per minute (primary metric)
    const breathsPerMinute = breathCount / sessionDurationMinutes;
    
    // Base score calculation (granular with decimals)
    let score;
    
    if (breathsPerMinute <= 1) {
      // 1 BPM or less (perfect): Score range 9.50 - 10.00
      const deviation = Math.abs(1 - breathsPerMinute);
      score = 10 - (deviation * 0.5); // Small penalty for going below 1
    } 
    else if (breathsPerMinute <= 4) {
      // Between 1-4 BPM: Score range 7.00 - 9.49
      score = 9.5 - ((breathsPerMinute - 1) * (2.5/3));
    } 
    else if (breathsPerMinute <= 6) {
      // Between 4-6 BPM: Score range 5.00 - 6.99
      score = 7 - ((breathsPerMinute - 4) * (2/2));
    } 
    else if (breathsPerMinute <= 12) {
      // Between 6-12 BPM: Score range 0.01 - 4.99
      score = 5 - ((breathsPerMinute - 6) * (5/6));
    } 
    else {
      // More than 12 BPM: Score is 0
      score = 0;
    }
    
    // Secondary adjustments for session length
    const durationBonus = Math.min(0.49, sessionDurationMinutes / 60);
    
    // For very good scores (7+), apply consistency adjustment
    let consistencyAdjustment = 0;
    if (score >= 7 && breathCount > 3) {
      // Calculate intervals between inhales
      const intervals = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < inhaleTimestamps.length - 1; i++) {
        intervals.push(inhaleTimestamps[i+1] - inhaleTimestamps[i]);
      }
      
      // Calculate stats
      const avgInterval = intervals.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0) / intervals.length;
      const stdDev = Math.sqrt(intervals.reduce((sum, val) => sum + Math.pow(val - avgInterval, 2), 0) / intervals.length);
      const cv = stdDev / avgInterval;
      
      // Apply adjustment (-0.25 to +0.25)
      consistencyAdjustment = 0.25 - (cv * 0.5);
      consistencyAdjustment = Math.max(-0.25, Math.min(0.25, consistencyAdjustment));
    }
    
    // Final score with all adjustments
    const finalScore = Math.max(0, Math.min(10, score + durationBonus + consistencyAdjustment));
    
    // Return score with 2 decimal places
    return parseFloat(finalScore.toFixed(2));
  }, []);

  return { calculateScore };
}


- *Session Management Hook:*
javascript
// useBreathingSession.js
export function useBreathingSession() {
  const [sessionState, setSessionState] = useState({
    isActive: false,
    startTime: null,
    inhaleTimestamps: [],
    exhaleTimestamps: [],
    stopTime: null
  });

  // Methods to control session
  const startSession = useCallback(() => {
    setSessionState({
      isActive: true,
      startTime: Date.now(),
      inhaleTimestamps: [],
      exhaleTimestamps: [],
      stopTime: null
    });
  }, []);

  const recordInhale = useCallback(() => {
    if (!sessionState.isActive) return;
    
    setSessionState(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      inhaleTimestamps: [...prev.inhaleTimestamps, Date.now()]
    }));
  }, [sessionState.isActive]);

  const recordExhale = useCallback(() => {
    if (!sessionState.isActive) return;
    
    setSessionState(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      exhaleTimestamps: [...prev.exhaleTimestamps, Date.now()]
    }));
  }, [sessionState.isActive]);

  const stopSession = useCallback(() => {
    if (!sessionState.isActive) return;
    
    setSessionState(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      isActive: false,
      stopTime: Date.now()
    }));
  }, [sessionState.isActive]);

  return {
    sessionState,
    startSession,
    recordInhale,
    recordExhale,
    stopSession
  };
}

# Enhancement Prompt for Simple Breath Score - Local Development

## CONTEXT
You're working with the existing Simple Breath Score application (simplebreathscore.com) locally. The app currently provides a quick breathing test with scoring functionality. Based on feedback from a yoga teacher, we need to enhance it with a dedicated meditative session mode while preserving the existing quick test functionality.

## CURRENT STATE
- Working React/Next.js breathing app with scoring algorithm
- Inhale/Exhale button interface with pleasant audio feedback
- Performance scoring based on breathing patterns
- Clean, simple UI design

## ENHANCEMENT REQUEST

### 1. **Homepage Redesign**
Add two distinct pathways:
- **"Quick Test"** button → Opens current scoring interface (preserve existing functionality)
- **"Meditative Session"** button → Opens new guided meditation interface

### 2. **New Meditative Session Interface**
Create a pre-session setup screen with sliders for:
- **Session Duration**: Total meditation length (e.g., 5-60 minutes)
- **Inhale Duration**: Length in seconds (e.g., 4-20 seconds)
- **Pause Duration**: Hold time in seconds (e.g., 4-20 seconds) 
- **Exhale Duration**: Length in seconds (e.g., 4-20 seconds)

### 3. **Guided Session Experience**
Once user starts the meditative session:
- **Visual Guide**: Clear indication of current phase (Inhale/Pause/Exhale)
- **Audio Cues**: Different sounds for each phase transition
  - Preserve the current pleasant inhale/exhale sounds
  - Add subtle sound for pause phase
  - End-of-session completion sound
- **Timer Display**: Show progress through current breath cycle and overall session
- **Automatic Progression**: No manual button pressing - follows the preset timing

### 4. **Session Completion & Scoring**
After the meditative session:
- **Adherence Score**: Rate how well the user followed the preset timing
- **Session Summary**: Display chosen parameters and completion status
- **Option to Save**: Store session preferences for future use

### 5. **Technical Implementation**
- Maintain existing React/Next.js architecture
- Preserve current scoring algorithm for quick tests
- Add new scoring logic for guided session adherence
- Keep the pleasant audio feedback system
- Ensure smooth transitions between modes
- Maintain responsive design

### 6. **UI/UX Considerations**
- Keep the clean, minimalist design aesthetic
- Ensure intuitive slider controls with clear value displays
- Provide visual feedback during the guided session
- Make it easy to switch between quick test and meditative modes
- Consider adding preset breathing patterns (4-4-4, 4-7-8, etc.)

## SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
- **Preserve**: All existing quick test functionality and scoring
- **Enhance**: Add the guided meditation capability without breaking current features
- **Maintain**: Current code quality and performance standards
- **Test**: Both modes work seamlessly and audio cues are properly timed

## DELIVERABLES
- Enhanced local codebase with both quick test and meditative session modes
